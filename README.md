## Overview

This project uses **Power BI** to create an Internal Audit Dashboard that provides a comprehensive analysis of audit data over selected years and departments. The dashboard visualizes key metrics related to risk ratings, audit outcomes, expenses, and departmental performance, allowing stakeholders to gain insights into audit effectiveness and organizational risk.

## Project Features

- **Risk Rating Analysis**: Breakdown of risk ratings (High, Medium, Low) by department, audit manager, and outcome, showing how risks are distributed across the organization.
  
- **Expenses Analysis**: Visuals for actual spending by department and expense type (e.g., Hotel, Dinner, Taxi), helping to monitor and control costs associated with various audit-related activities.
  
- **Audit Outcome Distribution**: Displays the status of audit outcomes (e.g., Work in Progress, Resolved, Litigation Required) to track the progress and success rate of audits over time.
  
- **Departmental Risk Overview**: Visualization of total amounts by department and risk type, offering insights into which areas may require more focus or additional resources.
  
- **Employee Expense Tracking**: Analysis of spending by individual employees and by category, allowing for more detailed monitoring of audit-related expenses.

## Visualizations

The Power BI dashboard leverages various charts and graphs to convey information effectively, including:

- **Risk Ratings by Manager**: Pie charts display the distribution of risk ratings assigned by each audit manager, providing a clear view of high-risk areas.
  
- **Risk Ratings by Department**: Bar charts showing risk levels for each department, allowing for quick identification of departments with higher risk profiles.
  
- **Audit Outcome Status**: Doughnut charts illustrate the proportion of audits in different statuses, such as completed, in progress, and pending resolution.
  
- **Departmental Expense Breakdown**: Detailed spending analysis by department and expense category to aid in expense management and identify potential savings.
  
- **Individual Expense Details**: Line charts and tables showing employee spending, categorized by types of expenses (e.g., meals, transportation).

## How to Use

1. **Analyze Risk Distributions**: Use the risk ratings by department and manager to understand which areas and individuals handle higher-risk tasks.
  
2. **Track Expense Trends**: Review spending by department and expense type to identify areas where expenses can be optimized.
  
3. **Monitor Audit Status**: View audit outcome distributions to track audit completion rates and identify any backlogs in audits that may need attention.

## Requirements

- **Power BI Desktop**: Open the Power BI dashboard file in Power BI Desktop to interact with and explore the data.

## Conclusion

This Internal Audit Analysis project provides a comprehensive view of audit performance, risk distribution, and expenses through interactive Power BI visualizations. The insights gained can support decision-making, risk management, and resource allocation within the organization.
